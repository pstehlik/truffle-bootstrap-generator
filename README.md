This project provides a simple way to generate a UI for your  [Truffle Contracts](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-contract) and interact with the contract methods through your browser. Ideally, you have [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) installed or are using another browser supporting [web3](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/), like [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases).
